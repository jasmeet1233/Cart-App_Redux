Store is used to store our data or a toll to manage data.
Now we will compare redux and useReducer.

Now everthing on redux is sophesticated. 
here consider store as a state, prev we used to destructure (const [] = useReducer()), now in redux we just put store, and create a store , like createStore(), and give the reducer and initial state.
As now we are working with redux, lets name it to initialStore = {}

Always return a state from a reducer. //updated or old state but return something

getState:
When we createa  store in redux functionw we have access to the getState function. with this, we will get or state

prev we had a array, which had the current state and dispatch func, now in redux its a object which is named store and toa ccess the current state and dispacth we use store.getState and store.dispatch

---Imp, Now if we are using redux in our project we will check for the current state from the reducer function, now whenever the page loads for the first time , we see what is reducer returning and that will be our initial state 



actions: we use stoer.dispatch({type:'INCREASE}), we do like this.
